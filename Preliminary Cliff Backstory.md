## About the Realm

In the world of Faerun, the dragons of lore are few and far between.  Most lost to the [Rage of Dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rage_of_Dragons) eons ago.  The deities of the [Draconic Pantheon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Draconic_pantheon) mostly abandoned and forgotten.  

In the sister mirror world of [Abier](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abeir), there be dragons a plenty.  Frequently socializing, warring, and interacting with fellow dragons along with the smaller beings like dragonborn, dwarves, and humans.  The Gods of dragon kind are known to some groups, prayed too, and reached out for in efforts to keep the balance between dragon and non dragon alike.

Cliff, until the recent past, was counted to be one of those dragon kind.  A gem drangonborn reigning form the mineral rich mountains outside of **Marranth**.  Nestled in the heights of the mountain lies a secretive abode known as Houpetor Shirpon. The Hidden Village.  A village purposefully isolated for safety from the ever waring dragons surrounding it.
## About the Hidden Village

> [!Note] Aesthetically, I was thinking of an amalgamation of Avatar: The Last Airbender Western Air Temple and the Kakariko village.

While all deities of the draconic pantheon are worshiped, the primary deity of worship is the god that inspired the secrecy of the Hidden Village, Sardior.   This village is inhabited by a few hundred creatures. Mostly gem dragonborn (90%) followed by a small number of chromatic and metallic dragonborn who align with Sardior's ideology (8%) and a holdout of dwarves who help with the shallow mining for gems and minerals into the mountains (2%).

The inhabitants of Hidden Village consider themselves to be a clan of one.  Eggs of new dragonborn are all placed in the same rookery. The clan are the parents to all children, and all children of the clan are brothers and sisters.  While the dwarves do their best to fit in with the culture of the Hidden Village, there is some underlying tension there due to the biological difference between the races.  For instance, the biological parents take on the guardian roles of their offspring.

- Sages of wisdom. 
- The adapts who are deemed the most adapt at dealing with secrets are taught the ways to go out into the rest of the world.
- The secret passages through the mountain are intentionally winding and confusing, and in certain parts of the journey, those who have not earned the secret are blindfolded.
- Those who know the ways can guide people to and back blindfolded.
- Anyone from the clan is allowed to leave, but most do not unless they are deemed worthy to be a guide to and from the Hidden Village.
- Prior to the events of this backstory, Cliff had intended to prove himself worthy to possess the secret pathways so that he might venture into the greater world for the village.  Being middleman for trade, finding out secrets worthy to pass to the sages of Sardior, and aiding those back to the village to seek out guidance from the sages and wise ones.

I'd take any suggestion.  I'd describe it as a village that finds safety due to the secularism of being on a mountainside.  I'm envisioning predominantly gem dragonborn, secondarily other dragonborn, then a few dwarved.



Cliff, until the recent past, was counted to be one of those dragon kind.  A gem drangonborn reigning form the mineral rich mountains outside of **Marranth**.  His home was a home devoted to the worshipping of the gods they deemed to be well intentioned such as Bahamut King of the Good Dragons, and Tamara the merciful.  These Gods were reached out to frequently in aide to keep the settlement safe from the frequently warring dragons nearby.

Cliff was a worshiper of [Sardior](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sardior) and  follower of Sardior's thane, [Smargard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Smargad) .  Drawn to the master of secrets , and wishing to emulate Smargard's skill.  Despite the ever bearing threat of dragon desolation,  the Cliff lived contentfully in his village.  Though he often wondered at the world at large.



 - Foreseers looked into the future and found a sense of foreboding. As if there was soon to be a pinnacle moment in the realms that could either see peace, or conflict emerge.
 - Whispers of events that could occur in the Fey Wilds, Faerun, and other realms reached the ears of the gods.  And provided visions to the worshipers
 - In preparation of this nearing threat,  worshipers increased their prayers.  Asking for boons and protections for trying times to come
 - In the late hours of twilight, Cliff and friends were in the height of their worship to Sardior and Io when events took place in rapid succession
	 - In the peak of prayers, the fabric of reality between Abier and the [denisigns of the Ruby Palace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby_Palace) thinned, then overlapped
	 - In this overlap of realities is where enemies of the dragon gods, perhaps primordials and sympathizers of [Io's](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Asgorath) nemesis, [Erek-Hus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Erek-Hus) , took advantage of the weakening barriers of reality to land an attack against the Ruby Palace.
	 - As the attacked occured, the worshipers, including Cliff, snapped to the reality of Ruby Palace, then an explosion from one of the primordials, jettisoned them out of a now demolished wall.  Falling seemingly to their peril from the floating island.
	- Cliff looses consciousness from the explosion.  When he awakes he has somehow miraculously survived the fall.  And can feel the psionic and magical gifts present in his self.
	- At first Cliff thinks he must have been returned to some other location in Abier,  but finding a nearby town of humans and the pale elvish folk disuades him.  Gentle probing lets him know that he is in IceWind Dale.
	- He has to make some very savvy bluff and persuasion to exchange is strange coin for the coinage of the realm.
	- His inquiries bring him to the attention of the Harpers.  Their piercing gazes soon determine that Cliff is more than just an outsider from this town, but an outsider of this realm.
	- They come to an agreement with Cliff that Cliff will work certain tasks presented in exchange for any info on his friends that were with him during the worhip.



## Spy for the harpers

It was the first creature that Cliff assumed was a pale drow, but was really a high elf, that turned out to be a higher member of the Harpers.  And while Cliff assumed his inquiries of the elf were discrete enough. They were not for a member as adapt at observation, with as broad of a spy network as [*insert elf name*].

[*insert elf name*] in isolation from crowds, confronted Cliff as to why he seemed so keen on the elf.  While Cliff spun elaborate flattery and falsities for justification of his inquiries, [*insert elf name*] was assessing the dragonborn's mannerisms and phrasings and comparing it with their knowledge of few gem dragonborn of the realm. They quickly ascertained that Cliff was more than just an outsider to Icewind Dale.

After getting Cliff to admit the truth of how he arrived, and his endeavor to find the kin which were ejected from the Ruby Palace,  [*insert elf name*] determined that Cliff could be a useful ally for the Harper cause, and came up to an arrangement to have his spy network seek out information on the whereabouts of the lost members of the Hidden Village. In exchange, Cliff would pass along useful information to the informants and be ready to take on tasks passed to him by the Harpers.

## What enemy attacks the Ruby Palace

I initially picked the Ruby Palace to be attacked by some primordial force due to the events that occurred in Waterdeep in the last campaign, along with an ancient primordial, [Erek-Hus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Erek-Hus), having been the one to have been rivals with and slain IO.  Maybe a faction of the primordial forces that were sympathetic to Erek-Hus' cause made a play as the barrier between realms was thinned?

The attacking enemies could also be [Obsidian Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLD0FQzVjxM&t=796s) as this group of gem dragon kin had been banished from the Ruby Palace long ago for mysterious reasons.  Maybe the banishment was just, or maybe not. Perhaps regardless of the validation Sardior had in banishment the group of obsidian dragons in the fire plane held a grudge, and decided to use maelstrom events to get retribution.

These are the two main ideas I have, but it could also be a faction from the Fey Wilds or other Plane looking to set off certain events to merge Toril and Abier back together.  Really, doesn't matter to me the who if there is a decent justification.



## Cliff's internal secret

Cliff's main focus is to find his kin and get them safely back home if possible. However, something he has not come to terms with due to internal guilt is that he actually doesn't want to return home.  While there is certainly dangers to be had in Icewind Dale with the extreme cold and darkness, the freedom of movement provided to him is like none he ever experienced in the quite isolated village. For his whole life Cliff had always been part of a clan, looking to do what was best for the clan first.  Here, he is much more independent, and that brings him both joy and shame.
