In the world of Faerun, the dragons of lore are few and far between.  Most lost to the [Rage of Dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rage_of_Dragons) eons ago.  The deities of the [Draconic Pantheon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Draconic_pantheon) mostly abandoned and forgotten.  

In the sister mirror world of [Abier](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abeir), there be dragons a plenty.  Frequently socializing, warring, and interacting with fellow dragons along with the smaller beings like dragonborn, dwarves, and humans.  The Gods of dragon kind are known, prayed too, and reached out for in efforts to keep the balance between dragon and non dragon alike.

Cliff, until the recent past, was counted to be one of those dragon kind.  A gem drangonborn reigning form the mineral rich mountains outside of **Marranth**.  His home was a home devoted to the worshipping of the gods they deemed to be well intentioned such as Asgorath the Ninefold Dragon, Bahamut King of the Good Dragons, and Tamara the merciful.  These Gods were reached out to frequently in aide to keep the settlement safe from the frequently warring dragons nearby.

Cliff was a worshiper of [Sardior](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sardior) and  follower of Sardior's thane, [Smargard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Smargad) .  Drawn to the master of secrets , and wishing to emulate Smargard's skill.  Despite the ever bearing threat of dragon desolation,  the Cliff lived contentfully in his village.  Though he often wondered at the world at large.



 - Foreseers looked into the future and found a sense of foreboding. As if there was soon to be a pinnacle moment in the realms that could either see peace, or conflict emerge.
 - Whispers of events that could occur in the Fey Wilds, Faerun, and other realms reached the ears of the gods.  And provided visions to the worshipers
 - In preparation of this nearing threat,  worshipers increased their prayers.  Asking for boons and protections for trying times to come
 - In the late hours of twilight, Cliff and friends were in the height of their worship to Sardior and Io when events took place in rapid succession
	 - In the peak of prayers, the fabric of reality between Abier and the [denisigns of the Ruby Palace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby_Palace) thinned, then overlapped
	 - In this overlap of realities is where enemies of the dragon gods, perhaps primordials and sympathizers of Asgorath's nemesis, [Erek-Hus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Erek-Hus) , took advantage of the weakening barriers of reality to land an attack against the Ruby Palace.
	 - As the attacked occured, the worshipers, including Cliff, snapped to the reality of Ruby Palace, then an explosion from one of the primordials, jettisoned them out of a now demolished wall.  Falling seemingly to their peril from the floating island.
	- Cliff looses consciousness from the explosion.  When he awakes he has somehow miraculously survived the fall.  And can feel the psionic and magical gifts present in his self.
	- At first Cliff thinks he must have been returned to some other location in Abier,  but finding a nearby town of humans and the pale elvish folk disuades him.  Gentle probing lets him know that he is in IceWind Dale.
	- He has to make some very savvy bluff and persuasion to exchange is strange coin for the coinage of the realm.
	- His inquiries bring him to the attention of the Harpers.  Their piercing gazes soon determine that Cliff is more than just an outsider from this town, but an outsider of this realm.
	- They come to an agreement with Cliff that Cliff will work certain tasks presented in exchange for any info on his friends that were with him during the worhip.



Spy of the harpers


Attacked by primordials, longstanding enemies of Asgorath and dragon kind.


**What is the village name? What is the village like**

I'd take any suggestion.  I'd describe it as a village that finds safety due to the secularism of being on a mountainside.  I'm envisioning predominantly gem dragonborn, secondarily other dragonborn, then a few dwarved.
