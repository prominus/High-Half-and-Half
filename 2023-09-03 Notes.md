Starting 10 tokens

Uses two tokens on dunking booth.

[[Jarlaxle]] is attending. 

Meet [[Esvele Rosznar]] near the mirror maze. Wearing crenulated high collar dress. Purple eye shadowing. Very vamped up. Extremely uncomfortable.  Interested in speaking as she has a dilemma.

[[Kressando ]]went to the skull port that exists to contact the [[Xanathar]]. I'm worried it's a resumption of the slave trade.  Asking to go to Undermountain.  

Meet few days at [[Yawning Portal]].

[[Brie]] steals [[Varis]] ribbon.

[[Edda]] hears in some part of the garden. [[Azalea]] [[Rosznar]], we tried to join the [[Cassalanter]], but we were rebuffed.  The nobles are not as they were.  We need to restore.  That man with [[Barnibus Blastwind]] should not be here. That fey filth should not be here. I want them to go away.

Thisia gontle talking with [[Yalah Gralhund]].  Thisia, "Well have more of the iron ore coming up next week.  Some miners thinking Founders day is a week.  More ore is more weapons against the goblins."  So [[Phaulkon]] are likely in debt to the wrong people.

Yalah,  They must be better than what they.  How much do they owe [[Phaulkon]]

[[Torres]] [[Agundar]],  to [[Jarlaxle]].  Does anyone know for certain if they are completely out. 

[[Jarlaxle]] connection to Lukson.

[[Mattis]] [[Durinbold]] and [[Lennete]].  Mattis, Feats of strength are not my forte.  Pay attention to Torres sr. People are noticing your occupation.  

Clap on the back.  [[Duane]] before me.

"Hello Thi-oh sorry. I mean Brie Cabernet."  I should be nicer for Marigold's sake.
Jasmine yells "Duane NOO."  

During [[Duane]]'s rant Brie stole the black and silver braid ribbon

[[Marigold]] comes up to Brie.  "I'm disappointed."

One men is [[Durnan]]. Owner of the [[Yawning Portal]]. Friend of [[Mirt]].  Warrior of some sort.  Talking on politics. Agreeing Mirt can't be one.

Walls of the maze 8 feet tall.  Flickering torches.  Exterior reflects many such torches.   Appearance changes on movement.  Along the way found a slightly damp jacket that [[Duane]] possessed.  

Naked bloody body [[Duane]]. 

[[Marigold]] is shocked and crying.  

Barnibus, Saeth, Magister Illither. Black robe.  

Duane has been stabbed six or seven times in the abdomen.

Yellow black threading.  Small piece. 

Residue around Duane's mouth.  Food and vomit.  Towel that holds vomit and blood.  

There is no blade or weapon that can be seen in this area.  All the earrings remain in place.  No sign of cuts, blemishes.  There was an appearance of significant traffic since installation of the prior day.  

Sofa with candles and flowers. Possible people got it on on the sofa.  

Jess.  Human 5' 3".  After that man humiliated Dua... I mean mister [[Phaulkon]].  I found his shirt on the path.  fellows talking.  I found his wet pants. He was naked.  Looked around me.  I turned and saw Brie. Whacked me on the head with something hard.  

Worked with Mr. Phaulkon for 6 months.  We were sometimes intimate. 

Rising of voices and clamor of people in the house.  Word is passing that there has been some tragic death.  Marigold slaps Brie across the face. 

Amongst [[Duane]]'s belongings.  Not in possession of his black and silver braid.  

Piece of damp parchment.  Mirror maze 9 o'clock - J 

Jess? [[Jarlaxle]]? [[Jasmine]]?

Further back the way was the jacket with the sodden shirt. Faint imprint of lipstick.  Shade is medium to dark red.  

Marigold's lipstick is dark red. Will have to check.

Closer to the estate find a glass flute not far from the walkway.  Small drops of liquid in the glass flute.  Might play with what G was interested in before.  

I don't think you have done this so you will have the assistance of the great [[Jarlaxle]] So then I can have my own revenge.  By the way... Are you still in possession of one of my men's pistols? -Jarlaxle to Brie.
