Decide to investigate around the Swiftfinger estate.  Talk to shopkeepers and any staff.

Swiftfinger villa is a 3 story stone building.  High walls and tree line.  Arrive and can see at a distance in time to see a coach arriving at the side entrance.  Can see the gnomish major domo Glintel.  Crook a finger to wait. Look inside and see some lights and candles.

See a man and a woman exiting from the door. Man and woman (Chris and wife) they are both wearing simple dark clothing.
