Music box guy is Mr. Swiftfinger.

Swiftfingers last words: Something about made you all.  You are already in bed with me as your captian. Asmodeus take you all.

Landy: Thank you so much. There is a plot for the founders day celebration.  Accellerated because of me. Research lead to Waterdeep.  Led me to a windmill on the specter walk.  Near verdess potions and poisons.  Led me to the storm weather villa. Near to Casalanter.  Brought to cells up. Haven't seen light of day since. Interrogated.

Caladorn Casalanter. Plate armor and mace emanating magical energy. Do you vow to use these items to defeat the forces of darkness. 

Silver bars pilled on this table. No door leaving this space
