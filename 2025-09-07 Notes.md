Descending into the maelstorm.  Thick stoned door.  Limestone and coral.  Strong currents sweep against you into the passage.  30 foot wide.  Full of swirling waters, erroding pillars dot.  Change in lighting suggest air above the liquid.  

Three pointed triangle of rock that looks to rep earth. Circular twisting swirl of lines that look flowing west to east. Like wind or air. 3rd symbol rounded bottom twisted peaks looks like fire.  Written in various languages "Let's groove tonight."
