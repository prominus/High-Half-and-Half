## Barnibus Questions

* Tell city watch to search the premises for discarded halfling clothing.  The suspect seemed pretty clean for stabbing Lord Duane multiple times.
* Contact the groundskeeper:
	* What are all possible exits from the maze?
	* What do you know of Jess?  What were her tasks for Duane? Would her tasks put her near the maze? Do you have a piece of her writing?
* Talk to the attendants of the archer booth, attendants of the dunking booth, and [[Durnan]]:
	* Who did you notice loitering near the maze the most?
	* Did you see Brie, and Duane? Together or Separate?  If together what transpired?  Any other interactions Duane had?
	* (Durnan specifically) who was the other person to you were talking to at the time?
* If Vivian is exposed: Who is this person? Where is her guardian? What is known of her?
* Is there an alchemist on hand to test this liquid?
* Did [[Barnibus Blastwind]] note if any of the attendants or musicians carry a glass flute?
