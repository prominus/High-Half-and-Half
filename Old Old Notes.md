“Worldchanger. Anam the allfather had an item created by dwarves and elves. Torque of silver and gold , emerald stone, eagle head. It would cause anyone who wore it to be exiled to the material plane with no hope of returning. Enmor giant deity schemed to overthrow the allfather. Memnore was unhappy that anam wouldn’t let giants be in material worlds. Memnore received the gift of a torq. When he dawned it he heard the words of Anam, ‘you will never see either again’. Memnore was transported to the material world. Banished to his ‘play thing’ as a simple giant. Could never break the barriers that separated the worlds. He drowned in the oceans, and the torq was gone and moved to lord of the dead. Yrgle was inscriber as secretary of the dead. The dead 3, bane, baal, and myrgle became gods in their own right. Kelemvore was disturbed with the coldness of Yrgle using undead and not caring of duties. Lord of the dead gave Yrgle a certain gold torq. ‘You should not have created undead’. With a flair Yrgle was on the material plane powerless but with his long live. With his power realm he tried to get to the realm of the gods using other gateways, but always rejected. Eventually the torq became into the possesion of giant folk. We held the story. We witheld this torq and new the power it represented. These tales past on, but the torq remained. My tribe hid it here at Candlekeep. It can only be destroyed by the token of the hand of the deity gifting the Bane. The blond eladrian Fariniel demanding the world changer. I involuntarily grabed at the torq at her throat. She opened that book, words were spoke and a portal open and the creatures emerged. “

Alluring eladrian, her dog and bug like sidekick. Drua of the dying breath. Humble adviser to the queen. Connected to a Siren?….

  

Peddle prince. Gangly eladrian with pale skin, a mole. Like french court.

  

Peddle Prince “Summer queen is ficcle and easily bored. Ask for favor for your great desire as it may be you who are out at weeks end.”

  

Summer Queen is not so petty. Keep my power, we will meet later for penance.

Something everesca. Drought has brought everesca to the brink. Owner wanted to get endless decanter of water. Possibly in the desert? Reference to a mad ancient king. Attacked by unknown warriors in dune skiffs. Taken to a bedin trime in the sand.

Similar statue in the southwest corner. Floor is layer of sand on top of stone tiles. Large stone block in south is the entrance. To east is a metal tube with concave end sunk into wall. 5 doors evenly spaced to the north of the wall.

  

Fire beetles scurrying around foraging in the sand. Rauve detects magic on the statue. Some sort of evocation magic and illusion magic. Illusion magic seems set upon the statue in front of varis and evocation magic from the floor.

  

Glyphs on the floor. Brie took lightning damage. Dead body also has lightning damage. He has boots and materials. 1 silver dagger with an emerald (around 125 gp). Right boot is a damaged set of theives tools. 7 copper and a silver mirror. Bone scroll tube with parchment (detect magic scroll & magic weapon). Empty water skin.

Calimshan. In dessert exotic places they would bury the dead, remove the vital organs, and place them in jars.

  

“Water will”

  

“istishia” – Brie thinking family came to Waterdeep from far away. Seems like a word associated with the four elements in some sort of religious way.

  

Vivian recall from one of the tutors brief mention talking about gods and entities of something known as istishia being called the water lord.

Braz Camal – The burrower, the benelevant, the benign

  

  

Flying from the north. Sand skiffs from the northeast. Coming from skulls in the sands. Returning from that place. No prisoners or slaves at that point. Rumors say these folk sell slaves to someone called, “Yarnath” and who has strange skeletal mobile headquarters. Hq known as slither. May be there where they were taken.

  

  

Build a skiff and head off to the skull place. Come to a place the skiff can’t go any longer

Necklace: seems to radiate magic. Looks like a torque, not round rod of metal. Two fangs with little bottles of coral.

  

Wand: appears to have some structure that looks like thin strands wound together. Metal effigy of a spider with a stone. Vivian is sure this a wand of web.

  

Mundane broom with not good bristles.

  

Last item is a rapier. Glow about this weapon.

  

Letters reference Yarnath. Reference his filactories. Looking for a blood jewel and crown of dust. Jewel is crystalized blood of ancient and primordeal entities. Has aquired the jewel, but seeking crown. Looking at a site in the desert. Crown would control a sand worm.

Daggers were hit with acid. Integrity has been compromised

  

Roland to 8hp and Celedon to 8

  

More than 2 years ago Varis.

  

8/1 – retconning that Celedon has passed.

  

Someone spoke to a sea captain last at Candlekeep. Home, many springs over time the water has declined. Rolen researched with Varis’ mother and learned of the magic bowl. Only ponds. Stop gap measure while guard was organized to go into the caves.

  

While Birch is meditating almost grabbed pan flutes and stopped. Feeling betrayed as these flutes were a gift from the traitor. Birch has a beach dream….

  

Party comes upon a caravan. Hour is getting late. A pair of archers brandish their weapons.

  

Azaam and patron sing. Sing believes not a threat.

  

Azaam is a regular trader. Right now working for the dragon and the village of parnast. “My caravan carries a number of goods. Statue is for shrine of axes. Paid to transport it securely. Depitching of the trifold queen. An elven deity.”

  

Personification of 3 elven goddesses. At some point in Parnast the statue was defaced by the cult of the dragon.

  

Brie took a desert garb from the caravan.

  

Murph the leader of the goblin raiders. New chief with bug bears and hobgoblins. Stole wood strips. 8 to 12 inches long. Nasty wood curved and jagged and broken on the edge.
