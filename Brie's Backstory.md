**Alias**: Brie Cabernet 
**Name**: Thistle Wilbin 

The [[Wilbins]] and the [[Russelbacks]] were prominent merchant families in [[Waterdeep]]. Years ago, both families vied for the favor and dominance to supply the noble families in their frequent soirees. 

At this time, two noble houses (the [[Durinbold]] and [[Lanngolyn]]) were forming an alliance sealed with a wedding celebration. To mark the event, the head of one of the houses intended to throw the most lavish wedding festival that [[Waterdeep]] has ever seen. The [[Wilbins]] apparently won out the favor due to their claims of being able to acquire evermead to serve the noble guests at high time.

The [[Russelbacks]] however, were not simply going to stand by and allow their rivals to enjoy this honor. They colluded with the [[Zhentarim]] to sabotage the event, and a certain Tiefling ([[Sigmund]]) was contracted to make the mead disappear. The deception was not discovered until the intended time that drinks were to be served, and so the “greatest” wedding festival ended up being a dry event. The festivities were gossiped over for a brief time before quickly falling into obscurity. 

Enfuriated over the luke-warm reception of party guests, and the clear incompetence of the [[Wilbin]]’s, the head of the noble family red marked the Wilbin’s merchant business. The Wilbin family quickly lost prestige, and soon enough customers. In rapid succession the members of the Wilbin clan, including the a young halfling by the name of Thistle, ended up on the streets. Thistle ended up needing to replace his name for Brie Cabernet, and skills of trade with skills of cut pursing and thievery merely to survive. 

Growing up constantly on the verge of bankruptcy, Brie at times needed to gather funds to keep up. Unfortunately for the rogue, the [[Russelbacks]] were a vindictive clan who not only wanted to tear down their rivals, but to see them suffer. So they were more than happy to provide loans with costly interests to Brie.

Brie was unable to keep up with the payments though, and soon he found out by his friend [[Varis]] that there was a bounty on his head from the [[Russelbacks]]. [[Varis]] having known the ill fate of Brie’s past, and disillusioned with clan rivalries in [[Waterdeep]], collaberated with Brie to leave the inner doings of Waterdeep behind.
