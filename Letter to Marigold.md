Dear Mari, (childhood nickname)

Words on paper seem inadequate to express my deepest sympathies for your loss.  Perhaps, I'd have an easier time if I listened to Da's lessons rather than skipping out to pilfer food from our parent's stocks.  By the gods, do you recall how often our father yelled about, "Learning your proper place," and, "Doing what's right?" Actually, I recall you lectured me just as often as he did.  If we were still back in those times a charming boyish smile might been enough to wash away all grievances.

But we aren't in the past, and it's foolish of me to dwell on those memories. Here we are, and after hardships I can only imagine you went through, you finally accomplished everything our parents wanted. If they could have been here I'm sure they would be just as proud of you as I am.  Instead of simply conveying that pride at your day of triumph, I partook in a game for my own selfish gratification.  With Duane now gone, the whole thing seems pointless.

Since our parent's left Waterdeep you focused on doing what was right based on our Da's teachings. Although my ways seems unconventional. Please know, I too try to do what is right.

Your thoughts on me must me mixed at this moment. Take whatever time you need. When you are ready, know that I am here for you.

Yours Truly,
Thistle

P.S. Your affairs are your own, but I'd be remiss if I didn't warn you about Jarlaxle.  His ostentatious and charm might seem harmless enough, but he devious and cunning. Do not trust him.
