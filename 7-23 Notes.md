Later evening.  The protective ward of [[Kolat's Tower]] is gone. Group could just walk out.

Melvin Wake. Groundskeeper. The city of the dead. Go see Melvin for Mirt. Something of concern for the city of the dead. 

Fey folk in good shape or condition. Down in Dock Ward.

Knock on the door. Excellence receives an invitation to the [[Phaulkon]]. From Lord [[Duane]] and Lady [[Marigold Phaulkon]]. Notice of reinstatement of the Falcon name.

From Melvin. There has been peculiarly muddy prints. Distinct smells of rot. Go investigate.

Spot near to the back to the mausoleum of a family of [[Brandath]].  Vivian recalls the [[Brandath]] name is connected to Lord Neverember.  Lord married to someone to [[Brandath]].  He is the one that hid the fortune to [[Waterdeep]].  [[Myrtle]] [[Brandath]] was her name.

Digging up. Found a mass grave of children. They are wearing plane, rough home spun clothing.  there is vomit and stuff around faces.  There is a mark on the bodies.  Looks like they have been branded.  

The brand is a strange symbol. Three inverted triangles upside down to look like a larger triangle.

Vivian and Brie recognize the symbol.  It is a religious symbol. Infernal symbol attributed to Asmodeus.

Seeing as there is residue on their faces, thinking children were poisoned.  Likely cause of death.

Brie also sees on the poor quality of clothing, all of the children were poor. Dock ward or field ward. One of the hands has a piece of paper:

	or Founder's Day cele

[[Brie Cabernet]], [[Varis]], and [[Vivian]] know they are in the summer month. Flame rule is coming upon us.  The first day is Founder's Day celebration. Celebration of [[Waterdeep]]. This celebration is a week away.

[[Mirt]] assembled wagons for a starter Tavern. Going to the North Ward for the new home. 

Collect bread. Smallish carrots. 4 Raspberry tarts.  

See occasional signs of discord with the fey and eladrian seeking jobs and opportunities.  See signs of "No fey".

Reach the North Ward. On Saerdoun Street.  Quietest area.  After the heist a fireball was detonated in the Troll Skull alley.  This blast killed 11 people.  A large hidden treasure obtained legally from Neverember.

Bent Nail. Steam and Steel. Corelon's Crown. Sepphir Post. Bookworms treasure. Tiger's eye. Frewns Brews.

Now close to 1 PM when arrive at Trollskull Tavern.

Amber Oak. Tree from the fey wild is in front of the Tavern.

An elvish ghost is in the Tavern:

	Thank the gods someone has arrived. I am beside myself. The Tavern is fallen into a terrible estate. These squatters...

Then there is a thunder bolt strike through the ghost to Varis.  There seemed to be a fight underway, but Edda begins to play and that causes a pause in the fight. Soon Edda calls for a ceasefire.

Greetings from [[Sassafras]]. Refuges from the fey wild.

We seek shelter and rest. No harm to others who don't want to harm to us. 

Stop at Steam and Steal for the pistol info.

Note there are troubles with Goblins in the North.
